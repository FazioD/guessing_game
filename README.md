This is my first piece of code and is a game related to a few basic questions about myself. I wanted to create a simple guessing game with with prompts to store the user input into a separate variable for each question followed by a reply.

//*joke for TA*//
A woman gets on a bus with her baby. The bus driver says: "Ugh, that's the ugliest baby I've ever seen!" The woman walks to the rear of the bus and sits down, fuming. She says to a man next to her: "The driver just insulted me!" The man says: "You go up there and tell him off. Go on, I'll hold your monkey for you."
